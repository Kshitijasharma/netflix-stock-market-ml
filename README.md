This Python project demonstrates the use of LSTM neural networks for predicting future values in time series data. Leveraging the PyTorch framework, the script reads historical closing prices from a CSV file, processes the data, and trains an LSTM model. The trained model is then employed to generate predictions, visually comparing them with actual values. This project provides a clear example of time series forecasting through deep learning techniques.
